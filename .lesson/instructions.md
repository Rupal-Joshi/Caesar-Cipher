# Instructions  

A program needs to be created that allows the user to enter a piece of plain text that will be encrypted using a user-defined key. 

The program should:

- Prompt for the encryption key.
- Prompt for the plain text to be encrypted.
- Store the plain text in upper case.
- Encrypt the plain text message.
- Display the encrypted text for the user.

The encryption will be based on a Caesar cipher. Each letter entered as plain text will be shifted forwards using the number given as the encryption key.

The program should work in the following way:

- Prompt the user to enter an encryption_key between 1 and 25.
- Use a function to populate a dictionary that will form the Caesar cipher. The function should:
- Accept the encryption_key as an argument.
- Create a dictionary called caesar.
- Add the space (`" "`) character to the dictionary.
- For each letter of the alphabet, it should create a dictionary pair that contains the plain text letter as the key and the encrypted letter as the value.
- If the encrypted letter is higher than Z, then it should go back 26 letters to mimic a Caesarâ€™s wheel.
- Return the caesar dictionary to the main program.
- Prompt the user to enter their plaintext message.
- Ensure the message is stored in upper case.
- Generate the ciphertext by taking each letter in plaintext and generating a new encrypted letter based on the cipher dictionary. 
- Display the ciphertext to the user.

Using the guidance in the scenario, create your Caesar cipher encryption program. 

Remember to test often and break the problem down into smaller steps if they become too challenging. For example, instead of encrypting the entire message, see if you can encrypt a single character. 

Test all aspects of your program by entering boundary, normal, and erroneous data. 

Add any appropriate data validation checks to your program. 

## Explorer Task
